## 5.18.1 release notes

**March 10, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.18.1, is now available for download.
This release fixes bugs that caused SQL migration failure on PostgreSQL 12, nil pointer panic due to OICD login, and sensu-backend restart upon agent disconnection.
It also includes a reliability improvement &mdash; a change to use the gRPC client rather than the embedded etcd client.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.18.1.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][121]) Fixed a bug that caused SQL migrations to fail on PostgreSQL 12.
- ([Commercial feature][121]) Fixed a bug where OIDC login could result in a nil pointer panic.
- Changed to using the gRPC client (rather than the embedded etcd client) to improve reliability and avoid nil pointer panics triggered by shutting down the embedded etcd client.
- The Sensu backend no longer hangs indefinitely if a file lock for the asset manager cannot be obtained. Instead, the backend returns an error after 60 seconds.
- Fixed a bug that caused sensu-backend to restart when agents disconnected.
- Fixed a bug where the backend would panic on some 32-bit systems.

## 5.18.0 release notes

**February 25, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.18.0, is now available for download.
This release delivers a number of improvements to the overall Sensu Go experience.
From automatic proxy entity creation to unique Sensu event IDs, it’s now much easier to use and troubleshoot your monitoring event pipelines!
If you’re working behind an HTTP proxy, you can now manage remote Sensu Go clusters, as sensuctl now honors proxy environment variables (e.g. HTTPS_PROXY).
This release also includes a number of fixes for usability bugs, making for the most polished release of Sensu Go yet, so go ahead and give it a download!

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.18.0.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- The `event.entity.entity_class` value now defaults to `proxy` for [`POST /events`][114] requests.
- If you use the [events API][118] to create a new event with an entity that does not already exist, the sensu-backend will automatically create a proxy entity when the event is published.
- Sensuctl now accepts Bonsai asset versions that include a prefix with the letter `v` (for example, `v1.2.0`).
- The version API now retrieves the Sensu agent version for the Sensu instance.
- Log messages now indicate which filter dropped an event.
- Sensu now reads and writes `initializationKey` to and from EtcdRoot, with legacy support (read-only) as a fallback.
- Sensu will now check for an HTTP response other than `200 OK` response when fetching assets.
- Updated Go version from 1.13.5 to 1.13.7.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][115]) [Label selectors][116] and [field selectors][117] now accept single and double quotes to identify strings.
- Fixed a bug that prevented wrapped resources from having their namespaces set by the default sensuctl configuration.
- Fixed a bug that prevented [API response filtering][119] from working properly for the silenced API.
- Improved event payload validation for the [events API][118] so that events that do not match the URL parameters on the `/events/:entity/:check` endpoint are rejected.
- Sensuctl now supports the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables.
- The [`auth/test` endpoint][120] now returns the correct error messages.

## 5.17.2 release notes

**February 19, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.17.2, is now available for download.
This release fixes a bug that could prevent commercial features from working after internal restart.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.17.2.

**FIXES:**

- Fixed a bug that could cause commercial HTTP routes to fail to initialize after an internal restart, preventing commercial features from working.

## 5.17.1 release notes

**January 31, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.17.1, is now available for download.
This release fixes a web UI issue that cleared selected filters when sorting an event list and a bug that prevented certain `.tar` assets from extracting.
It also includes sensuctl configuration improvements.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.17.1.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Asset names may now include capital letters.
- Running the `sensuctl configure` command now resets the sensuctl cluster configuration.
- When you use `--trusted-ca-file` to configure sensuctl, it now detects and saves the absolute file path in the cluster configuration.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) When a silencing entry expires or is removed, it is also removed from the silences view in the [web UI][107].
- Fixed a bug that prevented `.tar` assets from extracting if they contain hardlinked files.
- In the [web UI][107], sorting an event list view no longer clears the selected filters.

## 5.17.0 release notes

**January 28, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.17.0, is now available for download.
This is a significant release, with new features, improvements, and fixes!
We’re ecstatic to announce the release of secrets management, which eliminates the need to expose sensitive information in your Sensu configuration.
When a Sensu component (e.g. check, handler, etc.) requires a secret (like a username or password), Sensu will be able to fetch that information from one or more external secrets providers (e.g. HashiCorp Vault) and provide it to the Sensu component via temporary environment variables.
Secrets management allows you to move secrets out of your Sensu configuration, giving you the ability to safely and confidently share your Sensu configurations with your fellow Sensu users!
This release also includes per-entity keepalive event handler configuration, a sought-after feature for users who have migrated from Sensu 1.x to Sensu Go.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.17.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Added [HTTP API for secrets management][108], with a built-in `Env` secrets provider and support for HashiCorp Vault secrets management. The secrets provider resource is implemented for checks, mutators, and handlers.
- Added the `keepalive-handlers` agent configuration flag to specify the keepalive handlers to use for an entity's events.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Upgraded the size of the events auto-incremented ID in the PostgreSQL store to a 64-bit variant, which allows you to store many more events and avoids exhausting the sequence.
- ([Commercial feature][106]) [Initialization][109] via `sensu-backend init` is now implemented for Docker.
- ([Commercial feature][106]) UPN binding support has been re-introduced via the `default_upn_domain` configuration attribute.
- In the [web UI][107], labels that contain URLs are now clickable links.
- Added `event.entity.name` as a supported field for the [`fieldSelector`][110] query parameter.
- In the [web UI][107], users with implicit permissions to a namespace can now display resources within that namespace.
- Explicit access to namespaces can only be granted via [cluster-wide RBAC resources][111].
- You can now omit the namespace from an event in [`HTTP POST /events`][112] requests.
- Added support for the `--format` flag in the [sensuctl command list][113] subcommand.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Fixed a bug where the event check state was not present when using the PostgreSQL event store.
- ([Commercial feature][106]) Agent TLS authentication does not require a license.
- Fixed a memory leak in the entity cache.
- Fixed a bug that prevented `sensuctl entity delete` from returning an error when attempting to delete a non-existent entity.
- In the [web UI][107], fixed a bug that duplicated event history in the event timeline chart.
- `sensuctl command` assets installed via Bonsai now use the `sensuctl` namespace.
- Fixed a bug where failing check TTL events could occur if keepalive failures had already occurred.

## 5.16.1 release notes

**December 18, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.1, is now available for download.
This release fixes a performance regression that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased and includes a change to display the `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter by default.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.1.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- The `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter now initializes with the `success` label so the count is always displayed.

**FIXES:**

- The performance regression introduced in 5.15.0 that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased is fixed.

## 5.16.0 release notes

**December 16, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.0, is now available for download.
This is another important release, with many new features, improvements, and fixes.
We introduced an initialization subcommand for **new** installations that allows you to specify an admin username and password instead of using a pre-defined default.
We also added new backend flags to help you take advantage of etcd auto-discovery features and agent flags you can use to define a timeout period for critical and warning keepalive events.

New web UI features include a switcher that makes it easier to switch between namespaces in the dashboard, breadcrumbs on every page, OIDC authentication in the dashboard, a drawer that replaces the app bar to make more room for content, and more.

We also fixed issues with `sensuctl dump` and `sensuctl cluster health`, installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai, and missing namespaces in keepalive events and events created through the agent socket interface.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.0.

**IMPORTANT:**

- For Ubuntu/Debian and RHEL/CentOS installations, the backend is no longer seeded with a default admin username and password.
Users will need to [run 'sensu-backend init'][102] on every new installation and specify an admin username and password.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][105]) Users can now authenticate with OIDC in the dashboard.
- ([Commercial feature][105]) Label selectors now match the event's check and entity labels.
- Added a new flag,`--etcd-client-urls`, which should be used with sensu-backend when it is not operating as an etcd member.
The flag is also used by the new `sensu-backend init` subcommand.
- Added the ['sensu-backend init' subcommand][102].
- Added the [`--etcd-discovery`][100] and [`--etcd-discovery-srv`][100] flags to sensu-backend, which allow users to take advantage of the embedded etcd's auto-discovery features.
- Added [`--keepalive-critical-timeout`][101] to define the time after which a critical keepalive event should be created for an agent and [`--keepalive-warning-timeout`][101], which is an alias of `--keepalive-timeout` for backward compatibility.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][105]) The entity limit warning message is now displayed less aggressively and the warning threshold is proportional to the entity limit.
- A new switcher in the [web UI][103] makes it easier to switch namespaces in the dashboard.
Access the new component from the drawer or with the shortcut ctrl+k.
For users who have many namespaces, the switcher now includes fuzzy search and improved keyboard navigation.
- In the [web UI][103], replaced the app bar with an omnipresent drawer to increase the available space for content. Each page also now includes breadcrumbs.
- In the [Sensu documentation][104], links now point to the version of the product being run instead of the latest, which may be helpful when running an older version of Sensu.

**FIXES:**

- `sensuctl dump` help now shows the correct default value for the format flag.
- Installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai will now check for correct labels before checking if the asset has 1 or more builds.
- Listing assets with no results now returns an empty array.
- Fixed a panic that could occur when creating resources in a namespace that does not exist.
- Fixed an issue where keepalive events and events created through the agent's socket interface could be missing a namespace.
- Fixed an issue that could cause 'sensuctl cluster health' to hang indefinitely.
- ([Commercial feature][105]) The `agent.yml.example` file shipped with Sensu Agent for Windows packages now uses DOS-style line endings.

## 5.15.0 release notes

**November 19, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.15.0, is now available for download.
This is a significant release for a number of reasons.
The changes to licensing make 100% of Sensu Go's commercial features available for free to all users, up to your first 100 entities!
This release also includes the long-awaited cluster federation features, supporting multi-cluster authentication, RBAC policy replication, and a single pane of glass for your Sensu monitoring data!
We added support for API keys, making it easy to integrate with the Sensu API (you no longer need to manage JWTs).
In addition, the 5.15.0 release includes support for sensu-backend environment variables and bug fixes that improve error logging for mutator execution and flap detection weighting for checks.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.15.0.

**IMPORTANT:**
Sensu's free entity limit is now 100 entities.
All [commercial features][95] are available for free in the packaged Sensu Go distribution up to an entity limit of 100.
You will see a warning when you approach the 100-entity limit (at 75%).

If your Sensu instance includes more than 100 entities, [contact us][90] to learn how to upgrade your installation and increase your limit.
See [the blog announcement][91] for more information about our usage policy.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][95]) Added support for [federation replicators and the federation cluster registration API][85] and the ability to view resources across clusters in the federation in the [web UI][80].
- ([Commercial feature][95]) Added MSI and NuGet builds for [sensuctl][89]. Also, MSI and NuGet installations now add the bin directory to the system PATH on Windows.
- ([Commercial feature][95]) Added HTTP DELETE access for the [license management API][92].
- Added the [APIKey resource][86], with HTTP API support for POST, GET, and DELETE and [sensuctl commands][87] to manage the APIKey resource.
- Added support for using [API keys for API authentication][88].
- Added support for [sensuctl commands][93] to install, execute, list, and delete commands from Bonsai or a URL.
- Added support for sensu-backend service environment variables.
- Added support for [timezones in check `cron` strings][94].

**SECURITY:**

- ([Commercial feature][95]) Removed support for UPN binding without a binding account or anonymous binding, which allows Sensu to effectively refresh claims during access token renewal.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- You can now use colons and periods in all resource names (except users).

**FIXES:**

- Added better error logging for mutator execution.
- Fixed the order of flap detection weighting for checks.
- Fixed the pprof server so it only binds to localhost.
- Moved `corev2.BonsaiAsset` to `bonsai.Asset` and moved `corev2.OutdatedBonsaiAsset` to `bonsai.OutdatedAsset`.

## 5.14.2 release notes

**November 4, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.14.2, is now available for download.
This release includes an etcd upgrade, fixes that improve stability and performance, and a Sensu Go package for CentOS 8.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.14.2.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Upgraded etcd to 3.3.17.
- Added build package for CentOS 8 (`el/8`).
- Sensu Go now uses serializable event reads, which helps improve performance.

**FIXES:**

- As a result of upgrading etcd, TLS etcd clients that lose their connection will successfully reconnect when using `--no-embed-etcd`.
- Check TTL and keepalive switches are now correctly buried when associated events and entities are deleted.
As a result, Sensu now uses far fewer leases for check TTLs and keepalives, which improves stability for most deployments.
- Corrected a minor UX issue in interactive filter commands in sensuctl.

## 5.14.1 release notes

**October 16, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.14.1, is now available for download.
This release adds Prometheus gauges for check schedulers and fixes several bugs, including a bug discovered in 5.14.0 that prevented OIDC authentication providers from properly loading on start-up.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.14.1.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- Added Prometheus gauges for check schedulers.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][79]) Sensuctl will not incorrectly warn of entity limits for unlimited licenses.
- ([Commercial feature][79]) `oidc` authentication providers will now properly load on start-up.
- When opening a Bolt database that is already open, `sensu-agent` will not hang indefinitely.
- Running [`sensuctl dump`][84] for multiple resource types with the output format as YAML will not result in separators being printed to `STDOUT` instead of the specified file.
- Fixed a crash in sensu-backend (panic: send on closed channel).

## 5.14.0 release notes

**October 8, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.14.0, is now available for download.
This release includes feature additions like two new configuration options for backends using embedded etcd and a new SemVer field in entity resources.
In addition, this release includes enhanced TLS authentication support and bug fixes that restore check execution after a network error and enable round robin schedule recovery after quorum loss.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.14.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- The [web UI][80] now includes an error dialog option that allows users to wipe the application's persisted state (rather than having to manually wipe their local/session storage).
This can help in the rare case that something in the persisted state is leading to an uncaught exception.
- The [web UI][80] now respects the system preference for operating systems with support for selecting a preferred light or dark theme.
- `sensuctl dump` can now list the types of supported resources with `sensuctl dump --types`.
- The [entity resource][82] now includes the `sensu_agent_version` field, which reflects the Sensu Semantic Versioning (SemVer) version of the agent entity.
- There are two new [advanced configuration options][83] for `sensu-backend` using embedded etcd: `etcd-heartbeat-interval` and `etcd-election-timeout`.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][79]) Added support for mutual TLS authentication between agents and backends.
- ([Commercial feature][79]) Added support for CRL URLs for mTLS authentication.
- ([Commercial feature][79]) Support agent [TLS authentication][81] is usable with the sensu-backend.
- In the web UI, feedback is directed to Discourse rather than the GitHub repository's Issues page to facilitate discussion about feature requests.
- In the [web UI][80], when a user lands on a page inside a namespace that no longer exists or they do not have access to, the drawer opens to that namespace switcher to help clarify next steps.
- Updated Go version from 1.12.3 to 1.13.1.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][79]) `sensuctl` on Windows can now create Postgres resources.
- ([Commercial feature][79]) Fixed a bug that resulted in event metrics being ignored when using the Postgres store.
- Fixed a bug that caused checks to stop executing after a network error.
- Fixed a bug that prevented `sensuctl create` with `stdin` from working.
- Splayed proxy checks are executed every interval (instead of every interval + interval * splay_coverage).
- Proxy entity labels and annotations are now redacted in the web UI as expected.
- Fixed a bug in the ring that prevented round robin schedules from recovering after quorum loss.
- Updated [web UI][80] so that unauthorized errors emitted while creating silences or resolving events are caught and a notification is presented to communicate what occurred.
- [Web UI][80] does not report internal errors when a user attempts to queue an ad hoc check for a keepalive.
- Fixed a bug in the [web UI][80] that may have prevented users with appropriate roles from resolving events, queuing checks, and creating silenced entries.
- Asset builds are not separated into several assets unless the the tabular format is used in `sensuctl asset list`.
- The 'flag accessed but not defined' error is corrected in `sensuctl asset outdated`.

## 5.13.2 release notes

**September 19, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.13.2, is now available for download.
This is a stability release that fixes a bug for users who have the PostgreSQL event store enabled.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.13.2.

**FIXES:**

- Metrics handlers now correctly receive metric points when the postgresql event store is enabled.

## 5.13.1 release notes

**September 10, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.13.1, is now available for download.
This is a stability release with bug fixes for multi-build asset definitions causing a panic when no matching filters are found.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.13.1.

**FIXES:**

- Multi-build asset definitions with no matching filters will no longer cause a panic.
- Fixed the `oidc` authentication provider resource.

## 5.13.0 release notes

**September 9, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.13.0, is now available for download.
This is one of the most user-friendly releases yet!
Sensuctl now integrates with Bonsai, the Sensu Go asset index, making it easier than ever to fetch and use countless Sensu monitoring plugins and integrations.
Additionally, sensuctl now supports loading resource configuration files (e.g. checks) from directories and URLs.
But that's not all!
Sensuctl now provides a subcommand for exporting its configuration and API tokens to your shell environment.
Use sensuctl to provide cURL and custom scripts with fresh API access information!

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.13.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- Sensuctl now integrates with Bonsai, the Sensu Go asset index.
Run a single sensuctl command to add an asset to your Sensu cluster (e.g. `sensuctl asset add sensu/sensu-pagerduty-handler:1.1.0`).
Check to see which assets are outdated (new releases available) with the `outdated` subcommand (e.g. `sensuctl asset outdated`).
- Sensuctl now supports the `env` subcommand for exporting sensuctl configuration and API tokens to your shell environment (e.g. `eval $(sensuctl env)`).
- Sensuctl now supports loading multiple resource configuration files (e.g. checks and handlers) from directories!
Sensuctl can also load a file using a URL (e.g. `sensuctl create -r -f ./checks` and `sensuctl create -f https://my.blog.ca/sensu-go/check.yaml`).

**FIXES:**

- Sensuctl interactive check create and update modes now have `none` for the metric output format as the first highlighted option instead of `nagios-perfdata`.
- Fixed a bug where silences would not expire on event resolution.

## 5.12.0 release notes

**August 26, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.12.0, is now available for download.
There are some exciting feature additions in this release, including the ability to output resources to a file from sensuctl and more granular control of check and check hook execution with an agent allow list.
Additionally, this release includes the ability to delete assets and more stability fixes around watcher functionality.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.12.0.

**IMPORTANT:**

Due to changes in the release process, Sensu binary-only archives are now named following the pattern `sensu-go_5.12.0_$OS_$ARCH.tar.gz`, where `$OS` is the operating system name and `$ARCH` is the CPU architecture.
These archives include all files in the top level directory.
See the [installation guide][16] for the latest download links.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- Operators can now authenticate to Sensu via OpenID Direct Connect (OIDC) using sensuctl.
See our [authentication documentation][17] for details.
- Added sensu-agent and sensuctl binary builds for FreeBSD.
- Added sensuctl dump command to output resources to a file or STDOUT, making it easier to back up your Sensu backends.
- Agents can now be configured with a whitelist of executables that are allowed to run as check and hook commands.
See the [agent reference][78] for more information.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Assets now support defining multiple builds, reducing the number of individual assets needed to cover disparate platforms in your infrastructure.
- ([Commercial feature][53]) Namespaces listed in both the web UI and sensuctl are now limited to the namespace to which the user has access.
- Hooks now support the use of assets.
- The event.check.name field has been added as a supported field selector.
- Both the API and sensuctl can now be used to delete assets.
- The use of ProtoBuf serialization/deserialization over WebSocket can now be negotiated between agent and backend.
- Web UI performance has been improved for deployments with many events and entities.
- The resource caches can now rebuild themselves in case of failures.
- Event and entity resources can now be created via the API without an explicit namespace.
The system will refer to the namespace in the request URL.
- Event and entity resources can now be created via the API using the POST verb.

**SECURITY:**

- To prevent writing sensitive data to logs, the backend no longer logs decoded check result and keepalive payloads.

**FIXES:**

- Tabular display of filters via sensuctl now displays `&&` or `||` as appropriate for inclusive and exclusive filters, respectively.
- Requesting events from the `GET /events/:entity` API endpoint now returns events only for the specified entity.
- Running sensuctl config view without configuration no longer causes a crash.
- Creating an entity via sensuctl with the `--interactive` flag now prompts for the entity name when it is not provided on the command line.
- Check hooks with `stdin: true` now receive actual event data on STDIN instead of an empty event.
- Some issues with check scheduling and updating have been fixed by refactoring the backend's watcher implementation.

**KNOWN ISSUES:**

- Authentication via OIDC is not yet supported in the web UI.
- Deleting an asset will not remove references to said asset.
It is the operator's responsibility to remove the asset from the runtime_assets field of the check, hook, filter, mutator, or handler.
- Deleting an asset will not remove the tarball or downloaded files from disk.
It is the operator's responsibility to clear the asset cache if necessary.

## 5.11.1 release notes

**July 18, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.11.1, is now available for download.
This is a stability release with bug fixes for UPN format binding token renewal and addition of agent heartbeats and configurable WebSocket connection negotiation.

See the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.11.1.

**FIXES:**

- Fixed access token renewal when UPN format binding was enabled.
- The agent now sends heartbeats to the backend to detect network failures and reconnect more quickly.
